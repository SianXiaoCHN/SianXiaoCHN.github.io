::: {#hero-heading}

I joined Goldman Sachs as a Quantitative Strategist within Risk in February 2025.

I am a soccer fan. I also love traveling and working out.

I'm now turning this website into a personal one instead of an academic one. Definitely sharing my life here.

Still keeping my proud research experience and **open to peer review requests**.
