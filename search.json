    "text": "It was great to pursue a Ph.D. degree following my childhood dream.\nI obtained his Ph.D. in Theoretical and Computational Chemistry at Southern Methodist University advised by Dr. Peng Tao.\nMy Ph.D. work focuses on the combination of computational structural biology and modern machine learning techniques. The research topic covers protein dynamics, protein allostery, drug desgin, and applications of machine learning and deep learning.\nThroughout my past study and research, some other topics I’ve worked on include perovskite solar cells, composite material with carbon nanotube modifications, chemical catalysis carried by ayered double hydroxides, etc.\nGlad to see I have over 400 citations now."
